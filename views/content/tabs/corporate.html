          Research shows that employees are more likely to stick with organizations that care and give back to the society and environment
          they operate in.
          <span class="bold">Engaging employees through corporate social responsibility initiatives</span> and helping them spread some cheer
          not only brings people together; it also humanizes you as a company with a soul.

          This said, corporate social responsibility is not only about the mandatory spends but about action, sustainability and giving
          back.
