        In an increasingly competitive talent market, a formidable employer brand can help
        <span class="bold">attract and retain the right kind of talent</span> just when you need it. Ensuring that you have a distinct brand image among existing and potential recruits can not only help
        <span class="bold">you save costs but also impact customer choices.</span>

        <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.willnevergrowup.com/blog/maintaining-work-life-balance/" class="bold" target="_blank">striking the right balance</a></span> between work and personal life while for others, it is about being respected and appreciated at work.
