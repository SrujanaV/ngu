                From getting every employee of Tata Sky believe and feel like a CEO to executing a Competency Project by anchoring behaviours through a creative visual campaign, we’ve partnered with Tata Sky over initiatives that have witnessed PAN-India impact. Besides
                these campaigns, we have also designed their Values &amp; Culture Handbook with easy-to-understand infographics and we are just getting started.

                With the objective of inculcating a sense of pride among employees in the logistics business, we partnered with DGF to create a three phase ‘Passionate Forwarder’ campaign. Across major cities in India, interactive workshops for the employees were executed
                with every Forwarder receiving a customised Pride Package that contained goodies specially made in line with the theme.

                  With the core objective of reliving and imbibing company values across the organization and adding value to Employee Engagement practices Never Grow Up &reg; partnered with Shoppers Stop to launch a 3 month initiative called 'IPledge'. While the idea
                  meant to reach out to every single person across the organization brought a new sense of camaraderie across employees and stores, this initiative also got our client into the
