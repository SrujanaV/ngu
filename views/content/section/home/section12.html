                <p>
                    This seemingly long & never ending scroll presents a compilation of some of our blogs. A lot of
                    these
                    have
                    also found their way into various leading <span class="bold">Human Resources</span> magazines or
                    <span class="bold">&nbspleading online publications like
                        Forbes India, People Matters, Indian Management Magazine, Smart Manager, Inc42, Times Ascent,
                        LinkedIn
                        Pulse & the World Human Resource Diary,</span> to list a few. Adapted and curated into
                    ‘snackable’
                    bytes, each
                    of
                    these snippets are pieces of a larger puzzle that offer you quick and practical advice on how to
                    manage
                    yourself and your teams better. This is a tribute to organizations with evolving work practices and

                <p>It does not matter what you read first. As long as you do. Everything as they say is connected. All

                <h5>The Curious Case of Never Growing Up!</h5>
                <p>Growing up comes at a cost. Somewhere along the line, in trying to conform to our boss and
                    society
                    at large, we tend to lose out on our ability to effortlessly think out-of-the-box, to be able
                    to
                    marvel at and appreciate the simplest of things or to just have fun doing what we love.
                    Questions
                    like ‘Why not?’ become ‘But why?’ – Ideas fizzle before they are born and insecurities amongst
                    colleagues creep up while reminding us to keep our head down and work because the long pending
                    promotion might come our way.</p>
                <p>
                    At Never Grow Up ®, a <span class="bold">work culture</span> and <span class="bold">employee
                        engagement</span> company,
                    getting into a deeper
                    understanding of what drives employees is serious business. Our take is that we are trying to
                    peel
                    off inhibitions that have evolved over the years at the workplace by creating a refreshing work
                    culture that is engaging, real, and alive. To be able to do that, we don’t just practice what
                    we
                    preach, we live it. There are small things we do which embody all that we stand for with our
                    <span class="bold">employee engagement ideas.</span>

                    Designations within our organization are just another example of us being ourselves. Every
                    individual in our team gets the freedom to pick a cartoon/ comic character that s/he associates
                    with and that’s not just on paper. It’s there on all our visiting cards, email signatures, and
                    LinkedIn profiles.
                    What’s in a name? Quite a lot, actually.

                    The Right Blend
                </h5>
                <p>
                    According to a study undertaken by the Arcadis’ Sustainable Cities Index of 2016, the Work-Life
                    Balance statistics in India have been rated amongst the “worst”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may be in denial about it, but everyone has phases of a failed work-life balance and lack of
                    awareness about the right <span class="bold">wellness program</span> at work. For <span class="bold">employer
                        branding</span>
                    to have the right impact,
                    integration is the key, not just at work, but at home. This means promoting a work culture that
                    not
                    only aligns with the company values but also with individual and life values. Not only that but
                    facilitating a flexible and ethical way of achieving high productivity is also important.

                    As leaders, the responsibility to ensure that our team does not burn out rests with us. This
                    means
                    that sometimes, taking a ‘people before process’ approach while monitoring the fact that
                    instances
                    do not become habits. This balancing act is easier said than done.

                <h5>
                    Are You Giving Your Team the Autonomy to Be Awesome?
                </h5>
                <p>Autonomy at work has been known to increase productivity in terms of both quality and quantity,
                    as
                    well as ensuring that people carry out their jobs for the greater good rather than just for
                    themselves.
                    Employers need to reconcile themselves with recruiting decisions they have made and learn to
                    delegate rather than micro-manage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, if an employer knows that the right resources are available then it’s easier to
                    come
                    to terms with employee autonomy, and easier for employees themselves to embrace a sense of
                    ownership. It’s important to acknowledge mistakes, and treat them as stepping stones to
                    improvement, rather than a point for withdrawing responsibility from people. Finally,
                    recognition
                    helps in fostering a sense of ownership and acts as a driving force.

                <h5>Myths About Corporate Offsites That HR Needs To Get Over!</h5>
                <p>Offsites – Are they all about <span class="bold">employee activities</span> or just an excuse to
                    conduct a team meeting in
                    a different space with fancy and luxurious surroundings? While theoretically, most people agree
                    that offsites are bonding sessions to integrate the team and allow everyone to have a good time
                    with their colleagues, in many cases, business discussions do end up happening. It’s thus
                    important
                    to have no business agenda for an offsite. Work discussions can always be conducted in the
                    nearest
                    conference room! </p>
                <p>Aside from this, though corporate hierarchy does exist, offsites are a good opportunity for team
                    members to interact with senior leadership by participating in <span class="bold">activities
                        for
                        team building</span>. All
                    this said and done, it’s unrealistic to expect immediate results from a team offsite. Patience
                    is a
                    virtue, remember?</p>
                <p>Over time, efforts will bear fruit, but it’s important to know that offsites alone are
                    insufficient
                    for high levels of employee engagement. Plan the offsite at a good time, conduct them
                    regularly,
                    and back them up with employee-friendly policies & recognition initiatives, and you will see an
                    upward engagement curve! </p>

                <p>Employee’s value or employee’s potential, who to choose between two equally competent employees
                    during a time of downsizing? These are factors that cannot be measured by a single equation or
                    algorithm. </p>
                <p>The risk of investing in a good workforce is one worth taking. When employees are approached
                    with a
                    “people first” mind-set, then providing them with the right work environment, scenarios and the
                    optimum push, becomes the way. Followed by regular <span class="bold">pulse surveys, soft skills
                        training,

                <p>Once this happens, employee productivity grows, and the potential is easier to evaluate.

                    employees will not necessarily increase turnover drastically. Observe. Engage. Challenge. Give

                    suffer from some or the other form of stress”. No, you do not need a drink. What you really
                    need is
                    a detox along with nutritional meal chart and a wellness program. The more organized you are,

                    more confidence you will gain to prioritize and solve your own problems.</p>
                <p>Take a day amidst nature to unwind and build up your optimism levels. Learn something new on a
                    regular basis. Keeping your mind healthy is equally important. Unable to decide what will suit
                    you
                    the best? Rewind. Rejuvenate. Recuperate. Do something that will help you Unplug! Every

                    suffers from stress at an unpredictable intensity. The solution lies in talking to people.

                    people
                    to stay at their current jobs more than <span class="bold">fun employee activities</span> that

                    but it may also be the case that despite these points, you have ceased to find any true meaning
                    in the work you do or that your dissatisfaction with the management has reached a new

                    if you won’t, your employers will. If you have proved yourself as a hard-working talent worth
                    retaining, your organization will happily direct your endeavours towards a cause or section
                    that

                <p>
                    A culture that reflects the values and vision of a company while maintaining a constant focus
                    on
                    the core <span class="bold"> employee engagement strategy</span> , is the key to managing

                    Hiring right wins half the
                    battle, because you ensure a rich culture at the outset, by building your team in a certain
                    way.
                    Encouraging change is not as straightforward, because it is a long-term process, but it is as,
                    if
                    not more, important.
                </p>

                <p>As the company accumulates people it needs to be ensured that the culture is developed and

                    importance. When employees encourage development among their peers, the communication is sound

                    Culture That Goes Beyond the Colour of the Collar
                </h5>
                <p>While in the corporate world today, there is a lot of talk on optimizing on diversity, bridging
                    gaps
                    and crossing borders, one divide remains - the one between white collars and blue collars.
                    Think
                    about it. Is the work culture in your organization only for the “educated”? Ideally, it
                    shouldn’t
                    be.

                    So, how do you transcend your work culture for your blue-collar employees? Conduct <span class="bold">pulse
                        surveys</span> to
                    understand what your employees need. A simple step could be to translate your corporate
                    mission,
                    vision and values into languages that your workers speak. To enable these employees to feel
                    more
                    secure in your organization, you could also implement policies that ensure positions in other
                    departments in the event that they might lose their jobs due to mechanization.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, financial stability is the biggest motivation for the majority of your wage-workers as
                    they
                    are in it for a basic salary that probably their whole family depends upon. Make sure that you
                    provide a competitive compensation and benefits plan. Undertake a <span class="bold">force
                        field
                        analysis</span> that helps
                    set a standard <span class="bold">competency framework&nbsp</span>for your employees. Reward your
                    daily
                    wagers for extra hours,
                    adherence to safety standards, regularity as well as commendable performance. Ultimately,
                    motivating blue-collar employees and making them realize that they are a part of the greater
                    work
                    culture is the key to a successful organization.</p>

                    induction and on-boarding? It is
                    important to translate organizational values into specific, relevant behaviours. Values then
                    become
                    the perfect way to assess people, their contribution to the organization and their growth curve
                    as
                    professionals. Of course, this assessment must be done in proper perspective because different
                    departments give priority to different values based on their roles in the company and which
                    values
                    fit into their job roles the best.</p>

                <p>One never stops learning. Learning leads to growth and development. Yes, it’s difficult to make
                    time, but micro-learning as a method is fast becoming the new <span class="bold"> ROI on
                        employee

                <p>With mobile phones being the go-to gadget for millennials, learning on-the-go in any free time
                    available has become the norm, making continuous learning more feasible for today’s workforce.
                    Virtual reality is another option, engaging and interesting in its approach, while still
                    achieving
                    the objective at hand. Workplace learning has never been so accessible! </p>

                    Besides building skills, it also enables people to take on work independently. This means as a
                    manager, you spend less time hand holding people and focus on the more important things that
                    need

                <h5>Employer Branding Strategy - The Benefit of Doubt</h5>
                <p>According to a survey conducted by Glassdoor, it was found that almost 79 percent of employees
                    gave
                    more importance to the perks and benefits a given company has got to offer as opposed to their
                    salary. The most-valued benefit of most employees is the provision of healthcare and health
                    insurance along with post-retirement pension and health benefits. The right kind of benefits
                    need
                    to be decided keeping in mind the culture and finances of the organization rather than just
                    rolling
                    out populist benefits that may look attractive.</p>
                <p>A great office space with comfortable seating, free lunch, and snacks, flexible working hours,
                    flexible deadlines, unlimited leaves, the absence of dress code, etc., frees up a lot of mind
                    space
                    which employees can then redirect to more productive things at work. While a good pay package
                    can
                    help in acquiring good talent, research shows that it is unlikely to retain them unless there
                    is a
                    real-time <span class="bold">soft skills training</span>, a positive work culture and values

                    Negotiations on the Leadership Path
                </h5>
                <p>Negotiations can be purely financial, and they can also be all the little hurdles you manoeuvre
                    as
                    you climb up the professional ladder. It all starts with the basics, when as a fresher you
                    enter a
                    company and get your bearings – assess the work environment, make friends with people, get
                    comfortable with your job role. After this, as you climb a rung on the ladder and you begin to
                    expand your repertoire. Step out of your comfort zone and step into a more evolved role
                    accompanied
                    with an effective <span class="bold">leadership development program</span>.</p>
                <p>The more responsibilities you take upon yourself, the more you need to negotiate, with people
                    and
                    with tasks. And before you know it, you’re going up the ladder on the path to leadership. This
                    is
                    if your negotiating skills incorporate a problem-solving, solution-oriented mind-set, and you
                    have
                    a consistent employee communication pipeline, simultaneously in place.</p>
                <p>Patience leads to great things, one of which is assuming a role of leadership. That’s the bright
                    light at the end of the negotiation tunnel. Life is a series of negotiations, and once we
                    embrace
                    this fact, we will climb and help others climb as well.</p>

                <h5>The Challenges in Building a Progressive Start-Up Culture</h5>
                <p>The culture of an establishment comes from its people. The entire team resonates this culture
                    and to
                    ensure that it is healthily built, there are four steps to pave the way.
                    One – Treating your employees as equals. Everyone’s opinion counts. It’s important to let
                    people
                    know that they are a part of the decision-making process.<br>

                    Two - Define your start-up culture with a strong EVP. S.P.E.L.L it out. What is it that defines
                    you
                    as an organization? What is your culture? What do you expect from the team as a whole? The
                    answers
                    to these questions need to be laid out clearly.
                </p>
                <p>Three - No short-cuts, please; maintain transparency. Big efforts count in the long run. Getting
                    the
                    job done is important, but even more important is getting the job done WELL.<br>

                    Four - Walk the talk keeping future <span class="bold"> leadership training</span> in mind.
                    Practice
                    what you preach. When you
                    live the culture you wish to see built, you become a role model for your employees.

                <h5>Beyond Employee Engagement Surveys: Decoding Happiness at Work</h5>
                <p>Happiness is extremely subjective. What makes one person happy, does almost nothing to the next
                    person. However, there are certain parameters that can be used to measure happiness at work in
                    particular. Aspects such as job security, mental and physical health, role-fit and sense of
                    ownership, all contribute to the overall happiness of an employee. </p>
                <p>Assessing these factors can give the company an idea of whether or not people are happy. When
                    happiness is unlocked, innovation, creativity, ownership and togetherness, all tie in, making
                    the
                    organization as a whole, significantly more productive. Conduct a <span class="bold">happiness
                        survey</span> and you might
                    just
                    realize that although all employees may seem to be engaged at work, but not all of them are
                    actually
                    happy.

                    Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality solutions have come a long way.
                </p>
                <p><span class="bold"> Employee engagement consultants</span> have created surveys that are

                    people actually answer questions in an honest and sincere manner. This helps us recruit better
                    and
                    these surveys can be carried out using tech tools and social sourcing can be streamlined. Of
                    course, any decision should be taken after considering whether or not it’s feasible and

                <p>Eating right and at the right time – An age-old mantra that has been neglected in the pursuit of

                    An empty stomach can make us irritable and keep us from the task at hand. Take away our ability

                <h5>Memoirs of a Team Offsite</h5>
                <p>What really are the parameters that organizations use to define an ‘offsite’? What matters is
                    not
                    the destination, but the journey. Being more practical as opposed to institutional. Making it
                    more
                    of a relaxing and a team bonding outing as compared to a two-day workaholics conferencing and

                    . </p>
                <p>There have often been multiple moments when organizations strive to create the perfect moments
                    at
                    official offsites. But what often gets overlooked is the fact that organizations, every once in
                    a
                    while, need to emphasize more on enhancing the work experience of the employee, without pushing
                    targets. Take a break and quickly reflect on what an offsite should possibly be like. Or,
                    maybe,
                    what it should definitely not be?</p>

                    interact across cultures and traditions.</p>
                <p>But then, there is also the question of who decides what gets celebrated and what doesn’t? Some
                    celebrations are state-specific, while some are community specific. It’s time to turn the
                    tables
                    and indulge in the festivity of ‘celebrating employees’ and not focus on key festivals. Because
                    <span class="bold"> employee recognition </span> is one celebration that transcends all
                    boundaries
                    and barriers. One that can
                    be placed above Baisakhi, Easter, Ugadi, Muharram, Paryushana, Navroz; or even Bihu! </p>
                <p>Our experience as consultants: You either choose to celebrate every festival or none at all.
                    When
                    you celebrate a festival at work with pomp and fervour; one that covers the ‘majority’ but
                    choose
                    to ignore the ones that a ‘smaller bunch’ choose to celebrate, you also somewhere create
                    unconscious biases among employees on what is and is not important. Thereby somewhere,
                    alienating
                    an audience. We have a national anthem but not a national festival except maybe for the T20

                    process
                    followed for appraisals, nor do the employers know what sort of inputs to give before, during
                    and
                    after the appraisal phase. A few of the <span class="bold"> great places to work India </span>

                    fair, effective and transparent. </p>
                <p>It’s how you set the right expectations with the right <span class="bold"> competency framework</span>
                    . One way is to ensure
                    that the assessment criteria are aligned with the organization’s values. Once such definitive
                    criteria are set, there are no surprises regarding the outcomes of appraisals. </p>
                <p>Another way to avoid unexpected outcomes is giving feedback regularly throughout the year so
                    employees know what they are doing right or wrong. We strongly recommend that appraisals should
                    not
                    simply be that time of the year when people just go through the motions. The purpose should be

                <h5>Work from Home and the Confusion Around it!</h5>
                <p>Whether you’re a start-up with a very distributed workforce, a multi-national organization with
                    global teams working together, or an agency that has only freelancers on-board, virtual teams
                    are
                    your reality. It’s not uncommon today to work on the same project with team members who are
                    miles
                    or even oceans apart, living in different time-zones and still delivering on the same
                    timelines.
                    It’s also not uncommon to hear about the many problems that arise out of working apart. But are
                    there any tried-and-tested ways to ensure that distance doesn’t become a barrier and there is
                    no
                    gap in communications? </p>
                <p>Research conducted via various people surveys reveals that working in a team actually present
                    with
                    you, not only aids communication with regard to work but also makes you more socially involved
                    and
                    thus happier at work. A need for a culture that does not make remote-working seem like a
                    problem
                    but rather an opportunity that allows the team to collaborate effectively by using innovative
                    and
                    efficient ways. Moreover, if you have certain teams working out of co-working spaces, it
                    automatically increases your scope to the network as an organization while also increasing your
                    visibility greatly.</p>

                <p>In any critical situation, creating an effective communication plan while there are significant

                    that

                    work, but
                    it also ensures that companies retain people. How should one go about doing this? Communicating
                    honestly and regularly is of utmost importance – giving employees a sense of transparency in
                    the
                    company and assuring them as to how well they are doing their jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    Appearing confident through stormy times also assures your employees that they are backed by a
                    solid support and empower them with a sense of confidence themselves. However, it’s equally
                    important to instil in them a sense of ownership, by encouraging them to take on
                    decision-making
                    roles.
                </p>

                <h5>Steps to Building Workplace Citizenship</h5>
                <p><i>“A team is not a group of people who work together. A team is a group of people who trust
                        each
                        other”</i> – Simon Sinek. This quote sums up beautifully what teamwork in fact is. </p>
                <p>Encouraging inter-team interaction is imperative to developing a workforce with a strong bond
                    and
                    trust between them. To enable people to bond across barriers, it’s important to encourage their
                    exploration of emotional intelligence. The bottom line is not just performance, it is the
                    behaviour
                    that individuals cultivate in themselves and that organizations nurture that eventually leads
                    to
                    good performance. </p>
                <p>Companies that encourage passion driven <span class="bold">corporate social responsibility</span>
                    are few. In addition to <span class="bold"> internal communications</span>, employees want to feel
                    a sense of ownership
                    and
                    belonging to the company.
                    Without this, work gets done not through sincere passion, but just as a compulsion – leading to
                    reduced productivity. Regular feedback but not to the extent of micro-managing is crucial as
                    well
                    and gives employees a sense of autonomy. Workplace citizens are what build the organization –

                    imposed on everyone, too much of a preoccupation with going by decorum, are only some of the
                    ways
                    to frustrate employees. In addition to this, ending up with an overload of work, beyond one’s
                    scope
                    and job role can leave many employees overwhelmed. </p>
                <p>What makes it worse is when people do something worthwhile, but it goes ignored and
                    unappreciated.
                    Training especially around softer aspects can go a long way in instilling the need for
                    acknowledgment to motivate employees to work harder, better and more happily. Once this
                    essential
                    fact is understood, <span class="bold">employee recognition&nbsp</span>initiatives can be launched
                    to
                    take appreciation to the

                <h5>Managing Stress-Taming the Sneaky Monster inside Our Heads</h5>
                <p>Stress, however small it is, builds up over time and ultimately leads to massive burnout, and
                    thus
                    should never be underestimated. Do not reach a point where your work habits become unhealthy
                    and
                    destroy your peace of mind, health, efficiency, and productivity. </p>
                <p>One way to ensure that life and work go smoothly is to plan work in an organized manner. Yes,
                    it’s
                    not possible to plan minute by minute, but to map out your day is crucial to a smooth flow.
                    Additionally, it helps to unwind and disconnect occasionally. To carry out a digital detox,
                    free of
                    distractions and disturbances, can do wonders for your focus and productivity and your stress
                    levels. After all, it is the outside world that adds to the mental stress in a big way. Most
                    companies now focus on engagement strategies as an important factor in employee productivity.
                    An
                    effective<span class="bold">&nbspwellness program</span> can also keep employees mentally hale and

                <h5>Reasons Why Your Company Initiatives Are Failing</h5>
                <p>As people leads, the onus lies on you in finding innovative methods to ensure that employees
                    feel
                    appreciated, motivated and committed. Clarity of purpose or the lack of it, is the most common
                    mistakes that initiatives unwittingly end up making.<br>

                    As a programme gets laid out, it is common for the larger objective behind the initiative to
                    get
                    lost in the process. And at the end of the day, if employees are not on the same page as you,
                    the
                    point of an initiative can easily turn moot.
                </p>
                <p>One way to stay connected to the employees’ and their needs, is to carry out regular <span class="bold">pulse
                        surveys</span>
                    to gauge the level of employee satisfaction. Focus on the long-term impact of an idea, be more
                    inclusive, encourage active participation, make a list of all the possible “things that can go
                    wrong”, and strive to improve the durability of the programme. </p>
                <p>Most often, a people initiative fails due to the lack of effective communication. Try new stuff
                    and
                    stay relevant while you take necessary action to carrying out the perfect programme. Every
                    initiative counts in making the right impression.</p>
                <p>From<span class="bold"> Talent Consulting to Talent Management</span> – The Smart Way
                    Planning ahead lies at the heart of all organizational goals and it is the one process that
                    determines all the individual elements that will be factored into the organization’s framework
                    in
                    the future – including, of course, the right talent.
                </p>
                <p>As a general rule, including more people in the decision-making process not only helps optimize
                    the
                    right talent you already have but helps your company gain foresight, and in some cases, an edge
                    when it comes to determining its fate in the future. It works as an incredible, beneficial
                    cycle –
                    if one were to let it run, that is. Taking insight from moreemployees regarding <span class="bold">employee
                        engagement ideas </span> and CSR initiatives will ensure alignment of talent from day one.</p>
                <p>The right talent in a company can achieve so much more than fulfilling job descriptions or
                    playing
                    pre-defined parts in the organizational story. Previously unexplored perspectives come into
                    view
                    and when this talent becomes a part of the core strategy meetings, rest assured your company
                    will
                    be steered in the right direction and invigorated with new, fresh talent.</p>

                    we

                    many. Decision makers beginning to rely on <span class="bold"> HR Technology </span> to drive

                <p>It ensures that new joiners stay on track and work at progressing their career. Gaining from
                    their

                    organization
                    longer, their feedback makes a lot of difference. The impartial professional standpoint that a
                    mentor can gauge helps you view challenges is a different light altogether. </p>
                <p>Having someone to guide, encourage and motivate you, someone to share difficulties, failures,

                <p>Creating an organizational culture might begin with verbalizing and writing down a mission,

                    and values statement but that’s definitely not where it ends. A healthy culture is rooted in
                    equality, opportunity, and camaraderie and fighting biases where every individual is valued,
                    understood and appreciated for who they are rather than what they are. For an organization to

                    how
