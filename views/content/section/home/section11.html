                        <p>Let’s face it, life can get busy sometimes. These are the times when no matter how hard we try to
                            find a balance between mindful living and mind-full living (Link to blog on the monkey mind),
                            our inner Zen eludes us. Every time you try to tune into yourself, a message notification beeps,
                            a mail chimes in your inbox, a reminder pings impatiently, an alarm buzzes and you go on repeat.
                            This cycle goes on till you feel the weight of the world on your shoulders and get looped into
                            a torrent of your work-life and personal life spilling into each other.

                        <p>
                            A unique, fun, experiential learning framework rooted in theories, research and practical concepts from Psychology, Neuroscience
                            and Creativity meant to address (and redress) the stress caused by our essential digital dependence
                            and the ‘instant-world’ we live in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Experience the joy of plugging out of things and rediscovering a whole lot by plugging back into the things that matter,
                            a <strong>detached attachment,</strong> if you will. Take a break,
                            un-wire before you un-hinge, unwind the coils of professional and personal expectations and breathe.
                            ‘Un’ a lot things to Plug into something valuable.
