In doing so, they instill in the women the confidence to set financial goals, to make informed financial choices, and to transact independently.\nMEET OUR FIELD FORCE\nSakhi\nThe Sakhi is an enterprising rural woman who has inculcated good financial habits as a direct outcome of Mein Pragati.\nThe torch bearer of our initiative, she helps villagers remain committed to achieving their financial goals. As someone who carries forward the CRISIL Mitra’s teachings, the Sakhi reiterates good financial practices through audio-messages; she also monitors progress and addresses the communities’ immediate financial needs.\n"," 2015\nOn we go, to Assam\nIn 2015, we trained a team of 100 CRISIL Mitras to strengthen the financial capabilities of individuals and communities in rural Assam. Since then, CRISIL has been reaching out to communities in Barpeta, Darrang, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon and Nalbari in Assam.\n"," Our CRISIL Mitras have also helped revive more than 500 Self-Help Groups (SHGs), making them functional once again. Many rural women in Assam approached CRISIL Mitras, expressing an intent to revive defunct SHGs.\nCRISIL Mitras help such SHGs, guiding members with registration, book-keeping, and other administrative requirements. SHGs have also increased savings, with guidance from CRISIL Mitras. Consequently, SHGs begin saving systematically.\n2015\n"," 2016\nHello Rajasthan\nOur geographic footprint extended to three districts in Rajasthan - Alwar, Dausa and Sikar, with 45 CRISIL Mitras. We were inspired to see our participants taking the onus to raise\nfinancial awareness in their own families and neighbourhoods.\n"," STORIES OF CHANGE\nMaking resilience a way of life: Rashida Bibi\nIn a tragic turn of events, Rashida Bibi’s husband passed away in 2016. Our CRISIL Mitra, Moinuddin Ahmed, stood by the grieving family. He helped Rashida Bibi submit documents to file a claim for death benefit through the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana. Three months later, she received Rs. 2 lakhs in settlement.\nEquipped with her new found knowledge through Mein Pragati, Rashida Bibi thoughtfully invested a portion of the settlement in her late husband’s cloth shop and a fixed deposit. She also leased a piece of land for cultivation, and deposited the remainder in her bank account. Rashida Bibi’s household income increased by 45%. She continues to look up to Moinuddin for financial advice.\n"," STORIES OF CHANGE\nThe path to self-sustenance : Manalisha SHG\nThe Manalisha Self-Help Group from Kamrup, Assam undertook strawberry farming in a greenhouse. However, the group discontinued operations, and disintegrated, after incurring losses. When the group met CRISIL Mitra, Rubul Das, during Mein Pragati interventions, he encouraged them to resume using the green house as a source of income.\nWith a renewed sense of confidence, the group began cultivating lady fingers and chillies in the green house. Armed with financial management skills, Manalisha’s members now profitably manage the greenhouse.\n"," STORIES OF CHANGE\nCreating a ripple effect – Aarti Bhargava\n“Before the launch of Mein Pragati, most of our villagers were unaware of any social security or Government-sponsored schemes providing insurance and health cover. You know how the situation is in remote villages. Had I availed of an insurance scheme before my husband’s accident, our savings would not have been used up”, rues Aarti. Not one to give in, and as a leader of a Self-Help Group, Aarti encouraged 14 members of\nher group to invest in Jan Dhan and Bhamashah schemes.\n“Women’s consent was hardly ever taken for financial decisions. With the help of CRISIL Mitras, that has changed now”, she smiles.\n"," STORIES OF CHANGE\nChampioning awareness – Meera Devi\n“I am an Asha worker in Rajgarh, Alwar (Rajasthan). When I heard about Mein Pragati interventions in my community, I was keen to be a part of it.”\nWith her experience and network as a community health worker, Meera soon began championing financial awareness, leading to her selection as a\nSakhi for Mein Pragati. She now actively helps her fellow villagers complete documentation requirements for social security schemes and financial products/ services.\n"," 2017\nInto the hinterland\nWith a stamp of approval from India’s foremost banking regulator\nThe Reserve Bank of India invited CRISIL Foundation to set up MoneyWise Centers for Financial Literacy in Maharashtra and Haryana for a pilot.\nWe are the sole corporate-funded foundation empaneled by the RBI for its pilot to institutionalize support infrastructure for financial inclusion in villages. We have set up and will be managing 20 centres until 2020.\n"," STORIES OF CHANGE\n“No one like you has approached us with such information.”\nVinod Gazri, Mangrulpir (Maharashtra)\n“I like the programme, we all did. We learned about the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, insurance schemes (PMJDY, PMSBY) and the MUDRA scheme. I also learned that I could avail a loan. No one like you has approached us with such information. We will visit your centre to understand the facilities and financial schemes available to us. We have so far not been cheated and now with your guidance (on fraud prevention), we will not be\ncheated in the future either.\nOur villagers are not aware of anything that you shared today. Now that you are here, we want you to help us and the rest of the villagers, and make us aware (about financial schemes).”\n"," STORIES OF CHANGE\n“The members have also started repaying loan installments to the bank.”\nAshubi, Malarka village (Haryana) (Tauru block in Mewat, now known as Nuh)\n“Three of us set up a Self-Help Group (SHG) comprising 13 active members. The group has been operational for two years. We applied for an SHG loan. For about four months, we struggled to understand bank documentation and formalities. Then I happened to meet Poonam Devi - the Centre Manager of the Moneywise Centre for Financial Literacy, Tauru. I spoke to her about the trouble we were facing in understanding documentary\nrequirements and organising the paperwork. Poonam helped us comprehend bank formalities. She even accompanied us to the bank branch and helped with all formalities. With her support and guidance, our SHG received a loan. Our members have now invested in income-generating activities; some have set up a shop, or begun rearing a buffalo. The members have also started repaying loan installments to the bank.”\n"," 1,03,847\nWomen reached\n86,300 Bank accounts opened\n49,790 Loans 38,550 Insurance\npolicies\n2015\n25,763\n5,351\n5,804\n6,564\n2016\n32,963\n42,462\n17,539\n11,330\nAlwar\nOUR SOCIAL FOOTPRINT\n2017\n45,121\n38,487\n26,447\n20,656\n31,070\n26,715\n47,120\nAssam\nDarrang Morigaon\nRajasthan\n2016\n18,102\n13,500\n17,048\n49,172\nRatnagiri\nMaharashtra\n2017\nHaryana\n2017\nVillagers reached\nVillagers reached\nSikar Dausa\nWomen reached\n35,473 Bank accounts opened\n64,075\nInsurance Policies\nKarnal Panipat\nGurugram\nMewat\nMoneyWise Centres for Financial Literacy\nWashim\n22,472\n21,596\nNalbari Kamrup\n2017\nBarpeta Goalpara\n"," EPILOGUE\nThe Beginning of the Future\nMein Pragati is an initiative for change...\n...A change in the way economically disadvantaged individuals think about money, manage money, and make financial decisions.\n...A change in the way these individuals access financial services. ...A change in their way of living.\nWe will continue to be drivers for a positive wave of change, and by 2020, CRISIL Foundation will reach out to more than\n1 million individuals across India.\n"];
